      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Henry</strong>, but you can call me <strong>PastValley</strong> or just <strong>Past</strong>. I’ve always loved horror—ever since I was a kid, I spent my days watching scary videos, movies, drawings, and playing horror games. As I grew up, my fascination with the genre only became stronger.</p>
      <p>Today, I want to expand the world of horror using my own ideas. I create analog horror, drawings, stories, and anything terrifying I can bring to life. My goal is simple, but very important to me: I want my work to be recognized. One of my dreams is to be noticed by <strong>Dr. Nowhere</strong> (Silas Orion). Maybe someday I could even create an analog horror project with him—who knows? Haha!</p>
      <p>I have a lot of ideas I want to bring to life, and I hope to be known for my creations someday. I don’t plan to monetize my work unless I absolutely need funds for a project.</p>
      <p>This year, I began experimenting with ARGs, but I ended up abandoning the idea. First, because I wasn’t sure how to gain recognition with an ARG, and second, because I personally prefer analog horror much more.</p>
      <p>My favorite creation is called <strong>“The/”</strong>, a tall entity with a triangular head, large eyes, and an exposed heart on its chest.</p>
